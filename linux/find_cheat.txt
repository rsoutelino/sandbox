    # syntax:
find where-to-look criteria what-to-do

    # find a file
find /etc -name foo
    
    # ommit messages of permission denied in case you are not root
find / -name foo 2>/dev/null

    # you can search multiple directories
find /tmp /var/tmp /home -name foo

    # You can use shell-style wildcards in the â€‘name search argument:
find . -name foo\*txt

    # you can pipeline commands to act on the find output
find / -name core | xargs /bin/rm -f
find / -name core -delete                 

    # One of my favorite of the find criteria is used to locate files modified less than 10 minutes ago. 
find / -mmin -10
