The Short And Sweet Of It...
============================
Add this directory to your MATLAB path, and you are now setup to use
mexnc.  Check the READMEs for SNCTOOLS and the NetCDF Toolbox for 
further instructions.

Regarding Official Mathworks Support
=======================================================================
Beginning with R2008b, the MathWorks is shipping MATLAB with official
support for netCDF.  The interface looks somewhat different than mexnc,
but mexnc has been augmented to be able to use the native MathWorks
support instead of the mexnc mex-file.  Just think, all you windows
users, no more fooling around with getting the netcdf.dll installed 
into the proper location!

The first question that may arise here is "will my old code continue
to work?"  The answer is a qualified "yes".  Just about everything 
works as before (so far as I know), but there are a couple of 
exceptions.

    1.  Writing attributes with NaN or Inf does not result in the same
	    datatype as it did with the mexnc-2 interface.  Since I cannot
		think of a good reason why one would want to do this in the
		first place, I haven't much sympathy for anyone who has a 
		problem with this.

    2.  The memory-mapped I/O routines are not supported by the 
	    MathWorks native mex-file.  For example, one cannot use

		mexnc('PUT_VARM_DOUBLE',...)

		anymore.  I do not believe this to be much of an issue because
		the main thing that these routines was good for was to permute
		data, and MATLAB is much faster at this than the netCDF library
		anyway.



R2008a and Earlier
=======================================================================
If you have MATLAB versions R2008a or earlier, then you need to 
realize that you still need the mex-file mexnc.  This is not included
in this download.  You need to either retrieve it from an earlier
release at sourceforge or compile it yourself (the source code IS 
still included).  You can find the source code in the src subdirectory.

SUPPORT
=======================================================================
Please note, mexnc is NOT supported by The MathWorks, so please do
not ask them questions about it.  If you encounter problems with
mexnc, you should continue to use the same contact email address
that is listed on the sourceforge web site.


OPeNDAP
=======================================================================
If you wish to use an opendap-enabled version of mexnc, then you have to
compile your mex-file yourself.  Take a look at the online notes at 
http://mexcdf.sourceforge.net/opendap/ for further details.  You can 
also look at the various mexopts files in the src directory to try to
get a sense out of what you need to grok in order to get this done.  

Depending upon which release you have, you should try something like
the following.  Suppose you have R2008a.  In order to compile an opendap-
enabled mex-file, you would have to invoke

    make R2008a

If you have R2008b and higher and you want to use the native matlab 
functionality along with opendap, then you should first look at how
SNCTOOLS manages this.  It can use a java backend for all URLs while
using the native netcdf package for local I/O.  If you do not wish to
use SNCTOOLS, then you need to do a careful two-step dance with a 
preference.  When you are doing your opendap work, set this preference

    >> setpref('MEXNC','USE_TMW',true);

This will cause ALL I/O to go thru the opendap-enabled mex-file (that you
have to compile), so remember to turn the preference off when you are 
done with it.

Rolling your Own:
========================================================================
You shouldn't be thinking of compiling your own mex-file.  Please stop.

No really ... stop.

Alright, you really want to continue compiling your own mex-file?  Make
sure that the netcdf library is statically compiled (and hdf5 as well
if you want netcdf-4 support).  On linux, I configured hdf5 with

    CFLAGS="-fPIC" CXXFLAGS="-fPIC" ./configure --disable-shared
    --prefix=/path/to/hdf5/install
	
I configured netcdf with 

    CFLAGS="-fPIC" CXXFLAGS="-fPIC" ./configure --disable-shared
    --enable-netcdf-4 --with-hdf5=/path/to/hdf5/install 
	--prefix=/path/to/nc4/install
	
Then take a look at the bottom of the mexopts.R???*Âsh file in the src 
directory and make the necessary modifications.  Then run "make" with
the appropriate target.  Look at the makefile to see what targets are
available.
	

Problems?

I don't have a lot of time for mexnc anymore, but you can still email me
