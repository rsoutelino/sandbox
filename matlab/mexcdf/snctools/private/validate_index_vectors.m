% VALIDATE_INDEX_VECTORS
%    We need to check the lengths of the index vectors before calling the
%    netCDF library.  A bad length can confuse the mex-file, and it's really 
%    not the mex-file's responsibility to do this.  We can't do this when 
%    parsing the input arguments since we need the number of dimensions 
%    corresponding to the input variable.
